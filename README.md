# SCGDiff: A Comprehensive Framework for Enhancing Underwater Images by Utilizing a Gradient-Guided Diffusion Model Based on Swin Convolution Blocks
This is the supporting material for SCGDiff: A Comprehensive Framework for Enhancing Underwater Images by Utilizing a Gradient-Guided Diffusion Model Based on Swin Convolution Blocks, including code source code, data sets, and processed data renderings. All codes can run on GPU server clusters using A100. Due to the limitation of computing power, we only use 2 A100 graphics cards for each experiment.
